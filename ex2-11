I'm learning fullstack development by building my own investment application. This app
fetches various stock index data from the web (index can be selected by the user) and
allows search of stocks from different indices by name or ticker. I will also implement 
various filtering in the future (i.e. stock screener).

I've created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend and also docker-compose.yml.
My app will need database also, but that is future work. I will containerize that too.
